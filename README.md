# BoxOfficePrediction
Develop an advanced predictive model to forecast a film's box office revenue with precision and confidence. Utilizing a myriad of parameters, including budget, cast, genre, and past performance, our task is to leverage the power of machine learning to unravel the intricacies of box office dynamics and provide actionable insights for studios and filmmakers.

## Motivation
With the extensive data from TMDB_5000 dataset from kaggle, neumorous recomedation systems are built. However, the true potential of the dataset remains largely untapped. Our initiative aims to harness this wealth of information to predict a filim's expected revenue by leveraging a multitude of parameters and innovative feature engineering techniques, ultimately empovering stakeholders to make more informed decisions in ever-evolving landscape of the entertainment industry.
